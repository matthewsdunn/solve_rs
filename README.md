# ðŸ”¢ solve_rs ðŸ”­

## Overview ðŸ”Ž
solve_rs is a Rust script designed to solve Sudoku puzzles. At present, it
employs a brute-force based approach in which it tries each number combination
in order. The intent is for future iterations of the script to try to benefit
from ML/AI so that it might take a more "intelligent", and thus more efficient, approach.

## TODOs and Ideas for Improvement ðŸ’¡
- Script should be able to source external puzzle data

## An Important Note ðŸ“Œ
Although this solution is not particularly unique, I must give credit to
[this Medium post](https://medium.com/@george.seif94/solving-sudoku-using-a-simple-search-algorithm-3ac44857fee8), originally
written in C++. After porting the C++ code to Python as a learning exercise,
this project represents an attempt to further optimize and build upon those
earlier efforts.
