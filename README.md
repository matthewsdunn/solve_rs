## Overview ðŸ”Ž

**solve_rs** is a Rust script designed to solve Sudoku puzzles. At present, it
employs a brute-force based approach in which it tries each number combination
in order. The intent is for future iterations of the script to try to benefit
from ML/AI so that it might take a more "intelligent", and thus more efficient,
approach.

## TODOs and Ideas for Improvement ðŸ’¡

- Script should be able to source external puzzle data

## An Important Note ðŸ“Œ

Although this solution is not particularly unique, **I must give credit to
[this Medium post](https://medium.com/@george.seif94/solving-sudoku-using-a-simple-search-algorithm-3ac44857fee8)**, in which the
author chose to implement the solution in C++. The article provides an
excellent overview of the approach and an even better explanation of the
details of the algorithm. After porting the C++ code to Python as a learning
exercise, this project represents an attempt to further optimize and build upon
those earlier efforts.
